# React Boilerplate

Created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/)

## Pre-requisites

- Node(see `package.json` for version)
- Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) over `npm`

## Editor Integrations

I personally use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which comes handy for react development. Install tools in your own editor for better development.

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) for linting.
- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for formatting the code automatically.
- [Flow](https://flow.org/) for type checking.

`ESLint` is configured with errors from `Prettier` and `Flow`(see `.eslintrc`)

## Installation
```bash
git clone <git-url>
cd <repo-name>
yarn (or) npm i
```

## Development
```bash
yarn start (or) npm start
```
The development server opens the app at http://localhost:3000 in your default browser.

## Debugging

The browser's console is our best debugger. Yet download the developer tools for better debugging
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)
- If you use `redux`, see [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)

Also use devtools corresponding to any other packages you use in future.

## Coding Guidelines

Do not code like they used to code in 1990's. Code with [The next generation JavaScript](https://babeljs.io/)

There are lot of general guidelines. Here's few that I insist.

- Write clean(`Prettifier` will take care of this) and `DRY`(Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) code.
- Avoud mutating variables. Could use [ImmutableJs](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) if you like.
- Never use `var`. Use `const`
- Always use `arrow functions`(better binding of `this`)
- Use `spread` to concat arrays or objects
  ```js
  const a = {a: 1, b: 2}, c = {b: 0, c: 3}
  const d = {...a, ...c}
  ```
- Do not have more than `100` lines in a file. Break it up into multiple files.
- Do not use `a`, `x` or `temp` for variable/function names. The variable name itself should define what it does.
  ```js
  // Dirty
  const done = false;
  const complete = false;
  // Clean
  const isComplete = false;

  // Dirty
  const fetchUser = () => (
    fetch(uri) // Get from REST API
      .then(convertFormat) // Convert to snakeCase
      .then(validate) // Make sure the the user is valid
  );
  // Clean
  const fetchUser = () => (
    fetch(uri) // Get from REST API
      .then(snakeToCamelCase) // Convert to snakeCase
      .then(validateUser) // Make sure the the user is valid
  );
  ```
- Use [lodash](https://lodash.com/) for larger/nested array/object or complex calculations. 
- Use `camel case` for variables, functions & for almost everything
  ```js
  const first_name = "Radik" // wrong
  const name = {
    "first-name": "Radik", // wrong
    "firstName": "Radik", // correct
  }
  const firstName = "Radik" // correct
  ```
- Avoid passing new closures to subcomponents
  ```
  <input
    type="text"
    value={model.name}
    // onChange={(e) => { model.name = e.target.value }}
    // ^ Not this. Use the below
    onChange={this.handleChange}
    placeholder="Your Name"
  />
  ```

## Testing

Before testing, make sure to install [watchman](https://github.com/facebook/watchman)

```
yarn test (or) npm test
```
For testing in editor, go [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#editor-integration)

## Git

### General
- Never ever push to `master` branch(I'll kill u if u do so in my repo)
- Always work in a separate branch
- Rebase branch before raising a `PR`(Pull/Merge Request)
- Make sure to run tests(`yarn run test`) & validations(`yarn run validate`) before committing the changes.

### Branch naming conventions
- Use underscore to join words
- Use grouping words at the beginning of your branch name 
  ```bash
  #Dirty
  login_logout
  #Clean
  auth/login
  auth/logout
  #So you can group another branch like
  auth/forgot_password
  ```

### Commit messages
- Don't end commit message with a period(`.`)
- Add frequent commit messages
  ```bash
  #Dirty
  login and logout
  #Clean
  #Make separate commits for login and logout features
  login
  logout
  ```
- Provide descriptive commit messages
  ```bash
  #Dirty
  login page bug fix
  #Clean
  Fix login form UI bug
  - username label fix indentation
  - password icon increase size
  ```
- Begin commit message with `Add`, `Fix`, `Enhance`, `Increase`, `Reduce` words to be more specific on type of action you did
  ```bash
  Add login feature
  Remove forgot password feature
  Enhance logout page UI
  - Add logout icon
  - Reduce logout button size
  ```
### Hooks

`precommit` hooks are defined in `package.json`

So to make sure code doesn't have any errors(lint, flow, prettier, etc.) before committing, run `yarn run validate` to check the errors.
